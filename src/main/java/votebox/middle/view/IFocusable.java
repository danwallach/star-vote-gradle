 * We term these controls "focusable," and make them implement the interface
 * IFocusable. This term stems from the fact that these controls must be able to
 * communicate to the user that he is currently "focused" on them--that if he
 * presses some type of "select" control, that he will chose the item that is
 * "focused." The view can communicate to an IFocusable whether it would like it
