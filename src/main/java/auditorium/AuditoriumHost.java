/**
 * This is the top level class that an application should interface with if it
 * wishes to use auditorium.<br>
 * <br>
 * In addition to providing the library API for accessing the auditorium
 * network, this class is the keeper of three threads. In order to make sure
 * these threads are running when they should be, only interleave calls to the
 * API between a call to start() and stop().<br>
 * <b>Announce</b>: This thread takes announcements placed on the queue by the
 * user, formats them as messages (this includes signing), floods them to the
 * network and puts them into the log. <br>
 * <b>Receive</b>: This thread takes messages that are heard by individual
 * links and does the appropriate thing with them (ignore or flood/tell
 * application). <b>Join</b>: This thread listens for join requests, responds
 * appropriately, and sets up link structures.<br>
 * <br>
 * All thread synchronization (including the three aforementioned threads and
 * each link thread) is done in this class. This means that all other auditorium
 * classes are not thread safe. This is done to simplify matters.
