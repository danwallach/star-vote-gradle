/**
 * <b>Layers:</b> In an auditorium implementation, each layer is a stage which
 * a message must go through both when it is sent by a host and received by a
 * host. In code, each layer implementation must implement this interface. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b> Method Calls:</b>As should be obvious, each layer should decorate the
 * behavior of each of the methods in this interface of the layer below it. The
 * "links" between layers in an auditorium stack are these method calls. Layers
 * that are higher in the stack (closer to the application) must override
 * methods in this interface such that the behavior for the particular layer is
 * executed either before or after the decorated method call is made. This means
 * that for each method, information either flows from lower layers to higher
 * layers, or from higher layers to lower layers (which dictates whether the
 * decorated method call is made before or after the decorating behavior). This
 * is specified explicitly in the comments for each method. Because each layer
 * has something to contribute both to return values and parameters, return
 * values and parameters are also constructed in a layered manner using
 * s-expressions.<br>
 * <br>
 * When constructing a parameter to pass to a lower layer, do it in the
 * following way:<br>
 * ([action name] [parameter] [previous layer's payload)<br>
 * When constructing a return value, expect your parameter to come in this form
 * as well.<br>
